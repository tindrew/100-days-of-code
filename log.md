# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress** Coded for 1hr and 45 minutes tonight. Worked on my bootcamp course on UDEMY. Worked on Arrays and Array iteration using for loops. Moved the needle on the course frmo 40% to 41%. also started the javascript portion of FCC's beta curriculum. Completed 1 through 24.
**Thoughts:** Feel pretty good about my start. Really hoping using this will keep me motivated to keep churning, and also keep me from hopping around too much, which I feel is why learning to code has been difficult for me.

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet

### Day 2 June 2, 2017 
#####
**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour and 15 minutes tonight. Continued on the bootcamp course at UDEMY. Continued working on using for loops.

**Thoughts**: I am glad that I continued to code. I am not feeling like I understand loops 100%, and may revisit the loop videos tomorrow to make sure I have a good understanding of them before I move further into the course tomorrow evening. Hopefully I'll have a couple hours during the day to get through the loops again. I have to keep reminding myself that it's not about rushing through the course, but complete understanding of what I'm doing. Overall I think it was a good day. I am definitely beginning to get my head around arrays.



### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour and 30 minutes. Continuing on with my Udemy course.currently the course sits at 42%. Worked on forEach and arrays. Completed a codealong, a todo list where I can add to the list and delete from it.Not anything spectacular, but made to reinforce what I'm learning.

**Thoughts** I think I'm starting to get the hang of loops, and tonight's little program has gone a long way to help me with that. I think with a little more practice I'll have the hang of it. I'll know for sure tomorrow. The next thing to be done is a challenge where I have to write several loops from scratch that do different things. 


### Day 4: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It was a tough day. I spent 2 hours working on a single problem in my course. It was an array problem, where I had to make a function that would print out an array backwards. I wasn't able to find a solution to it without going to google, and decided not to look up anything. I don't want it to ruin my learning experience at this point.

**Thoughts** I think I'm going to go back and watch some of the earlier javascript videos and go through some of the stuff such as the different types of loops and such, then come back to these problems. Hopefully by then I'll have a better understanding of what it is I'm trying to do. At this point I'm pretty discouraged that I wasn't able to think through a solution, and it was the only problem in the bunch. What about the other problems? I can't even get through the first one.Hopefully after another round through the basics I'll be able to better understand what it is I'm supposed to do, and get solve the problems.
