# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress** Bootcamp Course: 41% 
Coded for 1hr and 45 minutes tonight. Worked on my bootcamp course on UDEMY. Worked on Arrays and Array iteration using for loops. Moved the needle on the course from 40% to 41%. also started the javascript portion of FCC's beta curriculum. Completed 1 through 24.
**Thoughts:** Feel pretty good about my start. Really hoping using this will keep me motivated to keep churning, and also keep me from hopping around too much, which I feel is why learning to code has been difficult for me.

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet

### Day 2 June 2, 2017 
#####
**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour and 15 minutes tonight. Continued on the bootcamp course at UDEMY. Continued working on using for loops.

**Thoughts**: I am glad that I continued to code. I am not feeling like I understand loops 100%, and may revisit the loop videos tomorrow to make sure I have a good understanding of them before I move further into the course tomorrow evening. Hopefully I'll have a couple hours during the day to get through the loops again. I have to keep reminding myself that it's not about rushing through the course, but complete understanding of what I'm doing. Overall I think it was a good day. I am definitely beginning to get my head around arrays.



### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour and 30 minutes. Continuing on with my Udemy course.currently the course sits at 42%. Worked on forEach and arrays. Completed a codealong, a todo list where I can add to the list and delete from it.Not anything spectacular, but made to reinforce what I'm learning.

**Thoughts** I think I'm starting to get the hang of loops, and tonight's little program has gone a long way to help me with that. I think with a little more practice I'll have the hang of it. I'll know for sure tomorrow. The next thing to be done is a challenge where I have to write several loops from scratch that do different things. 


### Day 4: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It was a tough day. I spent 2 hours working on a single problem in my course. It was an array problem, where I had to make a function that would print out an array backwards. I wasn't able to find a solution to it without going to google, and decided not to look up anything. I don't want it to ruin my learning experience at this point.

**Thoughts** I think I'm going to go back and watch some of the earlier javascript videos and go through some of the stuff such as the different types of loops and such, then come back to these problems. Hopefully by then I'll have a better understanding of what it is I'm trying to do. At this point I'm pretty discouraged that I wasn't able to think through a solution, and it was the only problem in the bunch. What about the other problems? I can't even get through the first one.Hopefully after another round through the basics I'll be able to better understand what it is I'm supposed to do, and solve the problems.


### Day 5: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 4 hours
  Today I spent a lot of time trying to figure out that one single problem. I refused to google it or look at the solution video because I didn't want to "ruin my learning", lol. After a lot of trial and error, I wrote a solution that actually worked properly! I submitted it to the Teaching Assistant Ian to check and make sure it's a good one, although I'm 98% sure it's correct. Or at least, one of many solutions that would work.
  
**Thoughts** Given all the time I spent trying to write an answer to a single problem, I feel pretty good about what I came up with. For me, part of the learning experience is absorbing what I've learned, not just understand it and move on, which is why I refused to google the problem. the TA Ian did tell me that googling is acceptable, they don't expect us to know everything. Maybe next time I get hung up on something I'll peak at google. Today was not that day. I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow after my code gets checked. Either way I was proud to have come up with a solution. Now, on to the other problems!


### Day 6: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes
 I found out that the solution I came up with was a good one. The TA Ian said it was a very creative solution,so that made me feel good. Coding is supposed to be about creativity after all. Spent 30 minutes today working on a solution for the next problem on the list. Still nothing solid yet though.
  
**Thoughts** Overall feeling pretty good. looking forward to making more headway on this journey.


### Day 7: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes
 came across an app for my tablet called sololearn that seems to have pretty good content. I'm going to start doing some when I have down time at work or anywhere else I don't have a computer handy. continued working on a solution to the second problem, and started Sololearn.
**Thoughts** Still struggling with the second problem. Very tempted to watch the solution video so I can move on, but continuing to resist the urge. 

### Day 8: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes
Not a lot of time today. Getting ready for company this weekend. Managed to do some SoloLearn and do a little bit of writing out small functions for practice.

**Thoughts** No terribly happy with today. Wishing I could spend more time on coding.


### Day 9: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 45 minutes
 Today was more basic practice writing functions. I'm trying to recreate my first problem just by writing out the code. Also spent more time doing SoloLearn when I have down time.
 
**Thoughts** I'm still here, plugging away. even though I'm not liking my current pace, I know that if I spend just a little time on it every day, I'll become successful. 

### Day 10: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour
Completed the last Array problems. Turns out there were both just a for loop and a forEach, although they both could have been completed with for loops. after that I did some more SoloLearn problems.
 
**Thoughts** I'm relieved to have those array problems out of the way. The last two were a lot easier than the first one, and that seemed to be the consensus in the Q&A section of the website. Despite the hiccup of being stuck on that first problem, I am ready and eager to keep going forward.

#############################################################################################################################

### Day 11: June 11, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour Bootcamp Course: 44%
44% into the course. I'm writing this as I'm still working, in case I fall asleep or something, lol. I'm currently to the object section, and learning interaction with objects and arrays. 
 
**Thoughts** Feeling pretty good. I feel I'm making great progress!


### Day 12: June 12, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes

Today I worked through some SoloLearn challenges, and some codecamp beta challenges as well. I didn't get as much done as I wanted.
**Thoughts** One thing I learned a long time ago is that any kind of progress is made daily, doing things day in and day out. Even if I didn't get more done, at least I completed something, which moves me forward on the Slight Edge just a bit more.


### Day 13: June 13, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes Bootcamp Course: 45%

Slowly but surely I'm moving through the course. Today I learned about Javascript Objects. I also discovered a cool website called CodeCombat, which seems aimed at younger people. You learn to code by programming a character in a game to do something, move, attack, etc. I tried it out and it's quite fun.

**Thoughts** Starting to get excited about this course again. I'm getting closer to making some real stuff, and learning the back end of development. Should be quite interesting.

### Day 14: June 14, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour Bootcamp Course: 48%

Moved the needle a good bit today. made it through basic DOM manipulation and starting the section on advanced. Events are next up.
**Thoughts** I really feel that I'm retaining what I'm learning, and starting to feel as if I can code anything, lol. I know it's probably not true as of yet, but my confidence is growing.

### Day 15: June 15, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes 
Today I completed some free codecamp beta challenges. I also decided to try and make a small javascript game for practice.

**Thoughts** I remember a time when I thought coding would be impossible for me to learn. I even tried out some java and python. Nothing stuck with me until I started learning html and css, then moved into javascript, and I've really learned a ton from the bootcamp course I'm taking. I'm glad there are people like Colt Steele who put together these insanely long courses for people like me to devour.

### Day 16: June 16, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour
Started working on a javascript "Pong" style game today. I'm following a free course on Udemy. It's more of a diversion, doing something different while still learning javascript.


**Thoughts** The short spurts of time I have sometimes during the week I'd rather spend on doing something, well, short. I'll most likely save my longer days for my bootcamp course since it takes the most time.

### Day 17: June 17, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour
Progressing with the pong game. Managed to get the ball moving and bouncing. 

**Thoughts** Not entirely sure I completely understand the code I'm having to do with this game tutorial. I can read the code, but there are some spots that are much more difficult. I'll keep moving though. Eventually it will all make sense I'm sure.

### Day 18 June 18, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
I now have the first paddle moving with the mouse in the pong game. I've started reading a javascript book that came with the game course I purchased on Udemy. 


**Thoughts** Just to keep things updated, I do intend to go back to my bootcamp course. I wanted to take a little break from it so I don't get burned out. I was starting to feel a bit fatigued, and not wanting to stop programming I opted for this game course. It will help reinforce my javascript skills, and keep me learning. 

### Day 19: June 19, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
Practiced my git skills. Adding files, commiting them. I haven't used git much up until now, so I wanted to make sure I'm comfortable with it. Practiced some html and css. 

**Thoughts** I am a little frustrated that neither course went into depth on buiding websites without making them responsive without using any kind of media queries(minus what bootstrap uses). I'm beginning to wonder if I should just take their advice - forget learning to write websites completely from scratch and just use bootstrap.


### Day 20: June 20, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour
Started working on my personal website. I want to have it done for when I start to finish projects, I need some place to show case them.

**Thoughts** I feel as though I am past the beginner stage of html and css. Probably the biggest thing for me though, is learning how to make websites responsive without resorting to a framework like bootstrap. Most of my courses essentially gloss over html and css and move directly into using bootstrap, and I haven't felt as if I have a solid grasp on html and javascript to the point where, if I had to work on someone's site that wasn't using a framework, I might not know what I was doing. So, I'm searching for a course that touches on the subject of media  queries and using strictly html and css.

#############################################################################################################################

### Day 21: June 21, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
Still working on my personal site. I am perhaps 20-30 percent done with it. Still a good ways to go.

**Thoughts** I don't have a lot to say at this point. I'm just slogging along. I've had a lot going on with work and such, but I'm glad that coding is now a daily habit. 


### Day 22: June 22, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hr 45 mins 
I found two courses on udemy that cover making a responsive website using media queries. The first one is free, and kind of short, so I'll be finishing that one first. The second one I haven't decided to purchase yet.

**Thoughts** The main reason i'm debating on the second is because I don't know enough about it yet. I can't figure out if it uses some kind of framework or not. I might bite the bullet tomorrow and purchase it.

### Day 23: June 23, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 3 hours
So I went ahead and purchased the second course after finishing the free one. The free one walked through a small, simple webpage that used maybe one media query. This second course seems legit. I've done up through the first section of the website, and it's looking really good. after looking ahead in the course, it only uses some css for a grid and media queries to make it responsive. The capstone project is very detailed. 

**Thoughts** Worked a lot on the second course. I'm really enjoying html and css again, now that I feel like I'm learning something solid and not just waffling trying to figure out how to put it all together.

### Day 24: June 24, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: 1 hour
  Worked more on the html and css. This course is definitely more in depth when it comes to using media queries etc. Glad I found it.
**Thoughts** I really feel as if I'm making some headway with html5 and css. Things are starting to come together.


### Day 25: June 25, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
More html and css. I am about halfway through the course already, I'm moving along at a very good pace. the beginning stuff is mostly review, I'm looking forward to getting through the course and into the capstone project.

**Thoughts** I definitely need to put some stank on this and get back to the javascript. I don't want to start forgetting what I know of that because I haven't done any javascript in a couple days.

### Day 26: June 26, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 3 hours
Started the capstone project. It's going well. I'm already learning things I didn't know about html, and I'm nowhere near the media query section yet.

**Thoughts** This course is pretty good. The instructor talks slow, and it is easy to type along with him while listening to what he has to say. I may look into the javascript course he has. I like his pacing a lot.

### Day 27: June 27, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
Practiced my git skills. Adding files, commiting them. I haven't used git much up until now, so I wanted to make sure I'm comfortable with it. Practiced some html and css. 

**Thoughts** I am a little frustrated that neither course went into depth on buiding websites without making them responsive without using any kind of media queries(minus what bootstrap uses). I'm beginning to wonder if I should just take their advice - forget learning to write websites completely from scratch and just use bootstrap.


### Day 28: June 28, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
Practiced my git skills. Adding files, commiting them. I haven't used git much up until now, so I wanted to make sure I'm comfortable with it. Practiced some html and css. 

**Thoughts** I am a little frustrated that neither course went into depth on buiding websites without making them responsive without using any kind of media queries(minus what bootstrap uses). I'm beginning to wonder if I should just take their advice - forget learning to write websites completely from scratch and just use bootstrap.


### Day 29: June 29, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 4 hours
Started working on my personal site. I really need to have the basic site done so I can start posting my other work to it as I get it finished. 

**Thoughts** I spent a bunch of time making a logo and then working on the first section of my site. I really needed to have some of the content done so I have something to put on it. Hoping to get it finished in the next few days.

### Day 30: June 30, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
Worked on some git, still trying to get the hang of commiting from command line in linux. Also watched a few javascript videos so I don't start losing what I learned.

**Thoughts** I"m still building my website. It's coming along well, I have the first section done. I wish I could work faster. Hopefully I won't always be this slow at it, lol.


#############################################################################################################################


### Day 31: July 1, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1hr 20 min
Restarted my website. I've been learning a lot of html, and some of the different things that you can do with it. I completed the first section of my site, and rewatched some of the javascript videos from my main course. 

**Thoughts** I"m still building my website. I was really expecting to have it done, but it turns out that I didn't know as much as I thought I did about html/css. The web developer courses I've been taking really gloss over it, I suppose assuming that whoever is taking it will not be focusing on the front end as much. While I'm not sure where I want to wind up (front end or backend or both) I don't like the idea of just having a rudimentary knowledge of the subject matter, and I'm certainly not going to rely on a framework until I understand what's going on with it. That's my point of view anyway.

### Day 32: July 2, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
Worked on my website, watched a couple videos. Made a new logo for the site.

**Thoughts** The site is still being built. I didn't get as much done today as I would like, but I'm still plugging away. Starting to get discouraged because this website still isn't finished, and I feel like I'm banging my head against the wall.

### Day 33: July 3, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min

**Thoughts** I"m still building my website. It's coming along well, I have the first section done. I wish I could work faster. Hopefully I won't always be this slow at it, lol.

### Day 34: July 4, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
Got my website to a place where I feel it's good for now. 

**Thoughts** I like where my website sits. I'm going to take a break for now and try to get back to working on javascript. I don't wnat to start forgetting what I've learned.

### Day 35: July 5, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min Watched 3-4 videos, coded a small "happy birthday" loop for a good friend of mine. Wrote it from scratch without looking at anything.

**Thoughts** Today I didn't do as much as I liked, but writing the loop was for me a small milestone. I wrote it without any help, without having to look at anything. 

### Day 36: July 6, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
  Started going back through the javascript videos on my course. I just want to make sure I have a good foundation.

**Thoughts** Things have been busy. I still manage to get in a little coding. Sometimes it takes a few steps backwards to get moving forward again. I just have to keep in mind that I've been coding for 36 days in a row. That in itself is worth something.
### Day 37: July 7, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
working on the loops section of the javascript videos again, coding along. 
**Thoughts** 
I seem to be retaining alot more, as I go through the exercises again I'm remembering not the solutions, but how to get them.

### Day 38: July 8, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min more javascript videos

**Thoughts** Getting close to where I left off on the course before I stopped to work on my website. Looking forward to ticking the course over the 50% mark. I thought I was there, and then it shows 49%. Not sure why, maybe I unchecked a video or something by accident.

### Day 39: July 9, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour 45 minutes
reworked through the javascript objects videos and exercises

**Thoughts** Had more time to code today and getting caught up again. Looking forward to doing some fun things with javascript. I'm beginning to really see the possibilities, how I can make websites do different things, or even make games if I want to. I want to hope that the sky really is the limit.


### Day 40: July 10, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 3 hours
Finished out the DOM manipulation and 98% done with Advanced DOM Manipulations sections and exercises.
**Thoughts** Whew! I burned through a lot today. I also hit the 50% mark of the course, which makes me very happy. I feel like I'm learning a ton, and hopefully it's just going to get easier to learn as things progress. i'm beginning to think of small projects I can do on my own afterwards. Probably a good idea to have some stuff on hand to work on after I finish the course. 


#############################################################################################################################


### Day 41: July 11, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 45 min
  worked some more on my pong game. 
**Thoughts** 
  Habit. It's the one thing that keeps things moving forward in any learning process. 21 days is what it takes to make something a habit. Day 42 has come and gone. I'm thankful to have started this journey, and I'm hoping some day to have the skills that I can pass down to my son. He's currently 1 1/2 years old. I signed up for my first Free Code Camp Meetup. It's 3 and a half hours away in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Looking forward to meeting some fellow coders.
  
 ### Day 42: July 12, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hr
  More pong game progress. Got the ball moving again(literally). Also, reached 51% on my web developer course.
**Thoughts** 
I'm pretty pleased with my overall progress. My ability to read code and understand what is going on is growing by leaps and bounds. I'm pretty confident that in a couple months I'll be job hunting. Even though this is day 42 of this 100 documented days of coding, I've actually been coding 82 days straight. I didn't officially document my progress until this git fork, but I had been programming 40 days before this. Documenting has definitely helped me stay on track.

 ### Day 43: July 13, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hr 
  Completed the computer AI for my pong game. only a couple of videos to go to finish the course.
**Thoughts*

Feeling pretty good today. I was able to find a bug in my code that was keeping me from continuing, and I was able to pass that fix along to someone else who had the same problem. Made me feel good knowing I figured it out without any help. I might be cut out for this coding thing after all.

### Day 44: July 14, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
Still working on the pong game. I wanted to finish it but didn't quite get it done. Hopefully will knock it out tomorrow.
**Thoughts*

I've reached a point where all I do is think about code. When I'm not coding I think about doing it. When I first started this whole thing I wasn't really "Passionate about coding". I wanted to do web development, but my drive to do it was no where near as intense as it is now.

 ### Day 45: July 15, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 HR Completed Pong game
  The pong game is finished. It is a rudimentary game, just two paddles, one controlled by the player, the other controlled by the computer. there's a score, a start over screen, just very basic. 
**Thoughts*

This was a fun project to get my feet wet in making games with javaScript. I fully intend to make some more. I love making games and seeing stuff happen on screen.

 ### Day 46: July 16, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time:  1 hr 20 minutes: Started a colors game in my Bootcamp course
Completed the first couple videos. Set up the documents, got the html, css and JavaScript documents set up. Also completed the first rudimentary game layout.
  
**Thoughts*

This project is going to be a lot of fun. I love making games! I'm thinking of ways I can extend this one, depending of course on how far the instructor takes it.

 ### Day 47: July 17, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 3 hours: about halfway through the colors game
  I did a lot today. I covered a lot of the main functionality.
**Thoughts*

I got stuck a few good times. One time I had to let the group look at my code. They were able to spot the error, but this experience makes me realize that I need to learn some good debugging methods aside from checking the console for errors. I did learn that I can console.log things to see what is going on, and that may be something I'll have to do in my own code more often.

 ### Day 48: July 18, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours Still working on colors game
  Had to stop after getting stuck on an error that I just couldn't figure out. The code looked right, but it's 1am and my eyes are probably just missing it.
  
**Thoughts*

I wanted to complete the game today but after getting stuck for a long period on a bug, I decided to give it a rest and try to figure it out tomorrow. I'm sure with fresh eyes I'll be able to find it.



 ### Day 49: July 19, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours Finished the colors game
  
**Thoughts*

This was such a fun project. Being able to fix the errors on my own really helped. There is still a lot I don't understand about JavaScript but I feel like I'm making headway. I have a couple ideas to flesh out this game, I'll update on this log once I start those pieces. For now, I'll probably be moving into jquery next.


 ### Day 50: July 20, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
  Did a few problems on free code camp and did some css practice. 
**Thoughts*

CSS is a ton harder than it looks. It's very easy to grasp the syntax, but actually getting good at it is going to be a challenge.


 ### Day 51: July 21, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time:1 hour 30 min
  Tusseled with my personal website, trying to figure out a good layout that suits me.
**Thoughts*

I'm not sure I'm anywhere near where I started with my website. I don't want to just jump on the Bootstrap bandwagon, but i'm not 100% sure I'm getting anywhere with just html and css.

 ### Day 52: July 22, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
  I finally decided on a layout for my website, and finished off the basics of it.
**Thoughts*

I decided that for my website, I'd have a static background image and scroll my content over top. I always want the background image to be visible in some way, so I'll have to see how this pans out. I'm hopeful that I can get a handle on it and get the basic site done soon. (Where have I heard that before?) Well, at least I'm trying.
 ### Day 53: July 23, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hr
  Still not further than yesterday on my site, I did learn a little bit of flex box. 
**Thoughts*

 I can't understand why CSS is so difficult to master. A good friend of mine tells me that's normal, and it takes a lot of time to really grasp what css to use and when. I suppose he's right.
 ### Day 54: July 24, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hr

Started a small javascript course on a website called watchandcode.com. It's supposed to be very functional javascript, which seems right up my alley. It's short, so I should be able to put it on my list of things completed.
  
**Thoughts*

I'm still pissed about my website. I thought I had a better handle on css but It turns out I was wrong. I'll take a break and come back to it. I'm not about to let CSS beat me.

 ### Day 55: July 25, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hr
  Discovered on a website called watchandcode.com. The teacher really stresses having a process to learning, which is not something other teachers of other courses have stressed. 

**Thoughts*

I really like it so far. I am about 20% of the way through it already. It's not a long course, but it covers the fundamentals of javascript. Since I feel like I need repetition, this is a good way to get it.

 ### Day 56: July 26, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hr 15 minutes
  reached 36% mark of the course on Watch and code. I stopped for a bit to work on rewriting the little program we have so far. I want to make sure I have a strong grounding on the fundamentals. After this course I will move on with my bootcamp course.
  
**Thoughts*

It might seem like I'm doing a lot of hopping around, but I promise I'm not. I have had to seek out other sources of learning the basics, because I need to learn it. Every bit of learning counts. I don't want to skip ahead in any course any more without knowing and fully understanding what it is I'm doing.

 ### Day 57: July 27, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
  Finished a couple videos in the Watch and Code course. 36% complete
**Thoughts*

Gaining some understanding of Object oriented programming, scratching the surface of it at the very least. The longer I go on the better I feel about my programming journey in general. yes, I still have doubts at times and still question whether or not I'm learning. I think that's normal though in any endevor.

 ### Day 58: July 28, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1hr Advanced to 40% of the Watch and Code Course
  
**Thoughts*

I was watching the video on for loops, and before the teacher said what he was going to do, I added the property of whatever.length to the for loop instead of just i = 3. I know that doesn't sound huge, but it is for me to have known where the instructor was going to go before he did. It just shows that I AM retaining stuff and not just mindlessly coding :D Also I asked a question on my Web Developer course concerning whether or not I should advance or stop and find some more things to practice. I was advised to continue on, and also given a link to another thread that went into some really good stuff, which also lead to some more links to more really good stuff. Lots of reading in my future :)

 ### Day 59: July 29, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours 50% through Watch and Code
  Worked on Watch and Code, also did some Free Code Camp.
**Thoughts*

Today's coding went great. Tomorrow I'm driving 3 and a half hours to for my first meet with my not so local Free Code Camp group. I discovered the group on the FCC forum. I made first contact, lol. Anyway, it will be fun meeting up with some fellow coders. At some point I may have to put together some sort of coding group here. Surely I can't be the only one in this area learning this stuff.

 ### Day 60: July 30, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min Free Code Camp
  Made some progress on the FCC site. Spent some time working on wrappng my head around switches and breaks.
**Thoughts*

I didn't get as much as I wanted done. That being said, the meetup was a blast. I connected with 3 or 4 people in the group. Looking forward to getting to know them. Totally worth the almost 4 hour drive.

 ### Day 61: July 31, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour FCC, Watch and Code
  
**Thoughts*

Not as much time to code today, wound up working a full shift when I was supposed to only open and get off at 4. Hoping to have more time tomorrow.

 ### Day 62: August 1, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour- Watch and Code 55%
  
  
**Thoughts*

This course is awesome. I don't understand why I hadn't run into it before. It covers javascript in such a way that goes over "advanced" subjects like ojects, which are usually reserved for later. 

### Day 63: August 2, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes watch and code: 57%
  
**Thoughts*

barely managed to get in any coding today. been having some computer issues, so trying to sort them out.
### Day 64: August 3, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes - SoloLearn
  
**Thoughts*

Still had Did some coding on my phone using the SoloLearn app. It's a good way to practice coding or reinforce concepts. I was able to iron out my computer issues, so hopefully I'll get more done tomorrow.

### Day 65: August 4, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours - watch and code: 65%
Moving through the course at a steady pace. added buttons and fields for adding todos and changing them.
  
**Thoughts*

I really wasn't expecting much out of this course when I first started it. It isnt a really long course but covers javascript in a way that keeps you focused on the project instead of teaching it in a boring fashion. A lot of courses attempt to teach it this way but don't seem to get it done. Really feel like I'm learning a lot from this one, and excited about my future as a developer.
### Day 66: August 5, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours 20 minutes - Watch and code 73%

  
**Thoughts*

This course has been a blast so far! now it is moving away from doing everything in the console, so that all the functionality of the app is there. I feel like I'm really getting a handle on javascript. once I'm done with this one, my plan is to A: finish my Boot Camp course, and also finish my JavaScript Game course. After that, I may work some more on my website and try to get some portfolio things in place. Most of my time currently has been spent learning. I think after finishing those two off I'll be at a good place to start getting some small projects done on my own.

### Day 67: August 6, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour Watch and code: 78%
  
**Thoughts*

Knocked out a huge chunk of the course. Really hoping that by the time I reach my 100 days I'm ready to job hunt but we'll see. I may need to give myself more time. 
### Day 68: August 7, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min watch and code: 81%
  
**Thoughts*

Only a little bit done. This week has been tough trying to cram in coding, but I know that by only putting one foot in front of the other will I complete anything, and so I keep plodding on.

### Day 69: August 8, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 45 min watch and code: 86%
  
**Thoughts*

Getting closer to finished. Didnt' have as much time to work on things the last few days. Did some computer work and just bogged down with the todo list.

### Day 70: August 9, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour Watch and code: 92%
  
**Thoughts*

The course is starting to get a bit, not tricky, but I know I'm going to need to cover a bit of this material again. Still, I've made huge progress in terms of my overall understanding of the language. Looking forward to more.
#############################################################################################################################

### Day 71: August 10, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 45 min Watch and Code: finished,
  
**Thoughts*

Thoughts about Watch and Code: fantastic course. It covered a bunch of things in javascript that I have yet to see in any other course such as higher order functions and callback functions. I'd heard the terms but never understood what they were. Now I do. I'm still not completely comfortable writing those yet, I will probably need to go back through the course to get a super solid understanding about how they work, but for now I'm finished with it after one time through.

### Day 72: August 11, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour
  Worked on my website. Restarted it. Finalized a design, a new logo, and began work on basic html and css. 
**Thoughts*

Now that I've learned a good bit of javascript, it's time to start implementing some into my website. I'm doing a redesign, and I'm planning to at least finish an iteration and hopefully making it live. That's my "project" for the next 10 days or so. Now that I'm nearing my 100 days of code ending, I want to have that finished at least, so I have something to add projects to and for employers to look at.
### Day 73: August 12, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 2 hours
  Still working on website. Implemented most of the html and css.
**Thoughts*

Work on the website is progressing. I never realized how many times I would redo the thing, lol. It still isn't live yet. I have started learning about Flexbox.

### Day 74: August 13, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: 1 hour - still working on my website
  
**Thoughts*

Flexbox seems somewhat easy to use, but it's still a learning process. I think I like it better than just using standard CSS  for moving stuff around.
### Day 75: August 14, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour - website work
  
**Thoughts*

still tweaking the website. I am starting to grasp flexbox. had to make a dummy site to practice some of the way it works. I used to think i'd want to be a full on front end designer. I'm not sure at this point. I might want to be more of a developer, implementing websites and building apps. I might get more aquainted with bootstrap soon. I didn't realize how much 'discovery' would be involved in this process. 

### Day 76: August 15, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes - free code camp 
**Thoughts*


Worked through a few problems on free code camp. didn't have as much time to work on things. The starter in my vehicle is failing, I hope I can make it to payday.

### Day 77: August 16, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min free code camp
  
**Thoughts*

The starter on my vehicle failed, been busy trying to get a part, trying to pull out the manifold because Honda thought it would be a great idea to bury the starter behind the manifold, and difficult to acccess any other way. I am still surprised that I have coded every single day non-stop. Not really surprised, since I know what it takes to make a habit. but a part of me is still like "wow, you're still going".

### Day 78: August 17, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 40 min boot camp course
 learning basics of Jquery 
**Thoughts*

I've started back on the boot camp course. I'm up to 56% now. Taking a break from my website. I at least have the basic site done.

### Day 79: August 18, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min
  boot camp course 57%
**Thoughts*

still crawling, but moving forward. that's the important thing.

### Day 80: August 19, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 45 min
  
**Thoughts*

twenty days left. My goal is to finish my bootcamp course, or get as close as I can, and also finish off my website. at least make it 'live'. This has been fun so far. I've uncovered something in myself that I wasn't expecting: a burning desire to write code. To build stuff. That feeling has grown the longer I've done this, I expect that feeling will just keep growing.
#############################################################################################################################

### Day 81: August 20, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min bootcamp course: 58%

Learning Jquery now. 
  
**Thoughts*

Jquery is fun, and seems easy to do, especially after working with javascript. Looking forward to seeing what I can do with it.
### Day 82: August 21, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time:  30 min Worked on website
  
**Thoughts*

decided to take a stab at using jquery in my website, mainly to try it out and see how it works on an actual site and not just exercises. Even though Jquery seems easy, I haven't memorized it so thank goodness for google. I'll continue working on this a bit and see where I wind up.
### Day 83: August 22, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour Website work
  
**Thoughts*

Spent a lot of time googling how to do things in jquery. When I first started learning to program I thought I would be memorizing more stuff, and just randomly write code out of my head. apparently that's not how it works. Hello, Google.

### Day 85: August 24, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: missed
  
**Thoughts*

Spent all of my spare time the last two days working on my SUV. It's the only vehicle we have, and the starter went out on it. I managed to fix that after pulling the manifold to get to the starter, and put it all back together. The vehicle started acting like it was overheating (the guage was running to the hot, although all the fans were runnning, etc) so I took it to the machanic. Turns out that was just a loose wire. They fixed that part, but apparently the vehicle has a bad wheel bearing. What was a two day repair is now going to take at least another week to fix. 
*******************************************
### Day 86: August 25, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 mins: exercises on soloLearn
  
**Thoughts*

I struggled with these. I'm just not feeling it after dealing with the stress of my car problem. It's my family's only vehicle, so I've been having to rely on rides for about a week, and now it will be at least another week before it's fixed. Hoping it doesn't cost a fortune. Need to pull my head out of my ass and get to coding. Will try to get more done tomorrow.

### Day 87: August 26, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour exercises on Code Fights, worked on my website
  
**Thoughts*
  
  Tried out Codefights for the first time. The exercises are fun. I am now beginning to think through the problems instead of just trying to code them out. I'm sure everyone does it differently. I'm now learning the process of pseudo-code. I write out what I need to have done, then I think about what I need to have in order to solve the problem and write that out. I'm still learning my process of course, I don't know exactly how it's going to be, but it's a start. And it's fun!
  
  
### Day 88: August 27, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes Free code camp
  
**Thoughts*

Finally finished a challenge I was stuck on, which I had skipped a long time ago, called counting cards. I finally found a solution which makes me very happy since I mostly wrote it myself with a couple of ideas from MDN talking about object properties.

### Day 89: August 28, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 mins Watched some Udemy videos
  
**Thoughts*

I'm having trouble getting time in. Still waiting on my car, having to borrow a vehicle once in awhile and hitching rides.
I didn't realize how much personal problems can affect focus, but it really does. I'm hanging on though.

### Day 90: August 29, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 min Watched more Udemy Videos
  
**Thoughts*

Not a lot to write today. Just trying to keep moving forward as much as I can.

**Thoughts*

Discovered CodingGame. It's another type of "challenge" website that you solve problems, only this one involves games. I'm hoping to do more on this site especially since I love games :P
### Day 96: September 5, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 mins CodinGame
  
**Thoughts*

The challenges are quite difficult on this site, which I don't mind because it stretches my brain. It may be that these things will take longer though.
### Day 97: September 6, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: 30 minutes watched some Bootstrap videos
  
**Thoughts*

Trying to implement bootstrap into my website, so I'm trying to get a better handle on it. It doesn't seem too hard, but it's nice to see how thing are implemented since just reading the docs isn't a great help initially.

### Day 98: September 7, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time:30 min codefights
  
**Thoughts*

Really loving code fights. It really makes my brain hurt trying to solve things, but it's so much fun. I think I'm starting to finally stretch about a bit. Also, Got my vehicle back so I finally have that stressor done with. It still needs a couple things, but in the meantime It's very drivable.

### Day 99: September 8, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour You don't Know JS: Up and Going
  
**Thoughts*

Seems like a really great book so far. The first bit has been mainly review, I don't think I've really picked up anything new yet. Looking forward to getting deeper in it. 

### Day 100: September 9, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 4 hours: challenges on free code camp, some more YDKJS
  
**Thoughts*
Final Day!!!

I have been coding for three months now. I am amazed at what I know, and sometimes terrified at what I don't. Parts of me think I should be able to plop down and write code with no trouble, but I keep forgetting that I wasn't able to write music just after 3 months of lessons. I took 10-11 years of lessons before I really started writing music. I don't think coding will take me that long, I definitely have a good grasp of things, and as I do challenges and complete them without looking at things I realize I and starting to get the hang of it. I am writing code. I'm going to be successful. This 100 days hasn't been perfect. I missed some days. I was hugely stressed out due to my car situation and being the only income coming in it was difficult. But I think that after doing this for so long, I have learned that not only can I code, but I enjoy it and it's something that I'm sure over time I can turn into a career. Looking forward to the next 100 days.
