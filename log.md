# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress** Bootcamp Course: 41% 
Coded for 1hr and 45 minutes tonight. Worked on my bootcamp course on UDEMY. Worked on Arrays and Array iteration using for loops. Moved the needle on the course from 40% to 41%. also started the javascript portion of FCC's beta curriculum. Completed 1 through 24.
**Thoughts:** Feel pretty good about my start. Really hoping using this will keep me motivated to keep churning, and also keep me from hopping around too much, which I feel is why learning to code has been difficult for me.

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet

### Day 2 June 2, 2017 
#####
**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour and 15 minutes tonight. Continued on the bootcamp course at UDEMY. Continued working on using for loops.

**Thoughts**: I am glad that I continued to code. I am not feeling like I understand loops 100%, and may revisit the loop videos tomorrow to make sure I have a good understanding of them before I move further into the course tomorrow evening. Hopefully I'll have a couple hours during the day to get through the loops again. I have to keep reminding myself that it's not about rushing through the course, but complete understanding of what I'm doing. Overall I think it was a good day. I am definitely beginning to get my head around arrays.



### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded for an hour and 30 minutes. Continuing on with my Udemy course.currently the course sits at 42%. Worked on forEach and arrays. Completed a codealong, a todo list where I can add to the list and delete from it.Not anything spectacular, but made to reinforce what I'm learning.

**Thoughts** I think I'm starting to get the hang of loops, and tonight's little program has gone a long way to help me with that. I think with a little more practice I'll have the hang of it. I'll know for sure tomorrow. The next thing to be done is a challenge where I have to write several loops from scratch that do different things. 


### Day 4: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: It was a tough day. I spent 2 hours working on a single problem in my course. It was an array problem, where I had to make a function that would print out an array backwards. I wasn't able to find a solution to it without going to google, and decided not to look up anything. I don't want it to ruin my learning experience at this point.

**Thoughts** I think I'm going to go back and watch some of the earlier javascript videos and go through some of the stuff such as the different types of loops and such, then come back to these problems. Hopefully by then I'll have a better understanding of what it is I'm trying to do. At this point I'm pretty discouraged that I wasn't able to think through a solution, and it was the only problem in the bunch. What about the other problems? I can't even get through the first one.Hopefully after another round through the basics I'll be able to better understand what it is I'm supposed to do, and solve the problems.


### Day 5: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 4 hours
  Today I spent a lot of time trying to figure out that one single problem. I refused to google it or look at the solution video because I didn't want to "ruin my learning", lol. After a lot of trial and error, I wrote a solution that actually worked properly! I submitted it to the Teaching Assistant Ian to check and make sure it's a good one, although I'm 98% sure it's correct. Or at least, one of many solutions that would work.
  
**Thoughts** Given all the time I spent trying to write an answer to a single problem, I feel pretty good about what I came up with. For me, part of the learning experience is absorbing what I've learned, not just understand it and move on, which is why I refused to google the problem. the TA Ian did tell me that googling is acceptable, they don't expect us to know everything. Maybe next time I get hung up on something I'll peak at google. Today was not that day. I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow after my code gets checked. Either way I was proud to have come up with a solution. Now, on to the other problems!


### Day 6: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes
 I found out that the solution I came up with was a good one. The TA Ian said it was a very creative solution,so that made me feel good. Coding is supposed to be about creativity after all. Spent 30 minutes today working on a solution for the next problem on the list. Still nothing solid yet though.
  
**Thoughts** Overall feeling pretty good. looking forward to making more headway on this journey.


### Day 7: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes
 came across an app for my tablet called sololearn that seems to have pretty good content. I'm going to start doing some when I have down time at work or anywhere else I don't have a computer handy. continued working on a solution to the second problem, and started Sololearn.
**Thoughts** Still struggling with the second problem. Very tempted to watch the solution video so I can move on, but continuing to resist the urge. 

### Day 8: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes
Not a lot of time today. Getting ready for company this weekend. Managed to do some SoloLearn and do a little bit of writing out small functions for practice.

**Thoughts** No terribly happy with today. Wishing I could spend more time on coding.


### Day 9: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 45 minutes
 Today was more basic practice writing functions. I'm trying to recreate my first problem just by writing out the code. Also spent more time doing SoloLearn when I have down time.
 
**Thoughts** I'm still here, plugging away. even though I'm not liking my current pace, I know that if I spend just a little time on it every day, I'll become successful. 

### Day 10: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour
Completed the last Array problems. Turns out there were both just a for loop and a forEach, although they both could have been completed with for loops. after that I did some more SoloLearn problems.
 
**Thoughts** I'm relieved to have those array problems out of the way. The last two were a lot easier than the first one, and that seemed to be the consensus in the Q&A section of the website. Despite the hiccup of being stuck on that first problem, I am ready and eager to keep going forward.


### Day 11: June 11, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour Bootcamp Course: 44%
44% into the course. I'm writing this as I'm still working, in case I fall asleep or something, lol. I'm currently to the object section, and learning interaction with objects and arrays. 
 
**Thoughts** Feeling pretty good. I feel I'm making great progress!


### Day 12: June 12, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes

Today I worked through some SoloLearn challenges, and some codecamp beta challenges as well. I didn't get as much done as I wanted.
**Thoughts** One thing I learned a long time ago is that any kind of progress is made daily, doing things day in and day out. Even if I didn't get more done, at least I completed something, which moves me forward on the Slight Edge just a bit more.


### Day 13: June 13, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes Bootcamp Course: 45%

Slowly but surely I'm moving through the course. Today I learned about Javascript Objects. I also discovered a cool website called CodeCombat, which seems aimed at younger people. You learn to code by programming a character in a game to do something, move, attack, etc. I tried it out and it's quite fun.

**Thoughts** Starting to get excited about this course again. I'm getting closer to making some real stuff, and learning the back end of development. Should be quite interesting.

### Day 14: June 14, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour Bootcamp Course: 48%

Moved the needle a good bit today. made it through basic DOM manipulation and starting the section on advanced. Events are next up.
**Thoughts** I really feel that I'm retaining what I'm learning, and starting to feel as if I can code anything, lol. I know it's probably not true as of yet, but my confidence is growing.

### Day 15: June 15, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 30 minutes 
Today I completed some free codecamp beta challenges. I also decided to try and make a small javascript game for practice.

**Thoughts** I remember a time when I thought coding would be impossible for me to learn. I even tried out some java and python. Nothing stuck with me until I started learning html and css, then moved into javascript, and I've really learned a ton from the bootcamp course I'm taking. I'm glad there are people like Colt Steele who put together these insanely long courses for people like me to devour.

### Day 16: June 16, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: time: 1 hour
Started working on a javascript "Pong" style game today. I'm following a free course on Udemy. It's more of a diversion, doing something different while still learning javascript.


**Thoughts** The short spurts of time I have sometimes during the week I'd rather spend on doing something, well, short. I'll most likely save my longer days for my bootcamp course since it takes the most time.
